## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).

## Installation and Setup
* Clone this repository
* Run `npm install`
* Run `bower install`
* Run `ng serve`
* If you get the error:

```
Versions of @angular/compiler-cli and typescript could not be determined.
The most common reason for this is a broken npm install.

Please make sure your package.json contains both @angular/compiler-cli and typescript in
devDependencies, then delete node_modules and package-lock.json (if you have one) and
run npm install again.
```

> run `npm install --dev` and `ng serve`

* If you get the error:
```
Your global Angular CLI version (1.6.0) is greater than your local
version (1.5.5). The local Angular CLI version is used.
```
> run
```
npm uninstall --save-dev angular-cli
```
followed by
```
npm install --save-dev @angular/cli@latest
```
